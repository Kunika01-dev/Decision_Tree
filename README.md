<h1 align='center'><u><b> Problem Statement :Income Prediction</h1>

<h3>In decision analysis, a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making.<br>
 As the name goes, it uses a tree-like model of decisions.</h3><br>

<h3>A decision tree is a flowchart like tree structure, where each internal node denotes a test on an attribute, each branch represents an outcome of the test, 
  and each leaf node (terminal node) holds a class label.</h3>
  
Below are the important sections:<br>
  
✔️Building a decision tree to predict the income of a given population, which is labelled as <= 50𝐾𝑎𝑛𝑑> 50K.<br>
✔️The attributes (predictors) are age, working class type, marital status, gender, race etc.<br>
✔️Data cleaning and Data modeling<br>
✔️Building a decision tree with default hyperparameters<br>
✔️Considering all the hyperparameters that can be tuned<br>
✔️Chooseing the optimal hyperparameters using grid search cross-validation.<br>
✔️Pruning of decision tree for considering relevant split/nodes.
